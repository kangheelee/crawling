       "[{'title': 'Nearly 3,000 illegal marijuana businesses found in California audit, dwarfing legal trade',\n",
       "  'content': 'California’s black market for cannabis is at least three times the size of its regulated weed industry, according to an audit made public Wednesday, the latest indication of the state’s continued struggle to tame a cannabis economy that has long operated in legal limbo. The audit, conducted by the United Cannabis Business Assn., found approximately 2,835 unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services operating in California. By comparison, only 873 cannabis sellers in the state are licensed, according to the Bureau of Cannabis Control. The figures are the latest sign of California’s rocky rollout of its legal marketplace, which promised better regulations and control beginning in 2018. Legitimate marijuana businesses have repeatedly criticized state leaders and law enforcement for failing to curb unlicensed dispensaries and delivery services, which sell cannabis at a much lower price by skirting state and municipal cannabis taxes. This year, an industry-backed financial audit projected that roughly $8.7 billion will be spent on unregulated cannabis products in California in 2019, compared with just $3.1 billion spent on cannabis sold by legal businesses. Officials have also warned that cannabis products sold in the illegal marketplace can pose health risks because the edible products, vaping pens and flower on shelves of illicit stores have not been subject to state testing. Since June, the California Department of Public Health has linked more than 60 cases of acute lung disease to patients who had recently used vape pens, and it warned that many of those people had recently purchased products from unlicensed shops. The UCBA, a trade association that represents dispensary owners, cultivators and other licensed marijuana businesses in the state, conducted its audit by scouring the popular and controversial website Weedmaps, which functions as a Yelp-like service for cannabis dispensaries and products. Lawrence Mansour, chief technology officer for APOP Media, a UCBA member focused on cannabis advertising, said he calculated the estimate of illegal operators by compiling a database of every California-based listing for a cannabis dispensary or delivery service on Weedmaps. Mansour said he found 3,757 listings, a number far higher than the total list of approved cannabis sellers registered in the state. Any attempt to quantify the number of unlicensed cannabis sellers in the state would be an estimate. The Bureau of Cannabis Control does not track such data, and there are illegal marijuana businesses in California that do not advertise on Weedmaps. The UCBA presented the audit’s findings in a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom and the cannabis agency early Wednesday and called for a crackdown on Weedmaps, which many in the cannabis industry have criticized for amplifying the reach of illegal sellers. “Every day that Weedmaps continues to advertise for unlicensed retailers they are putting consumers at risk and suppressing the growth and very existence of the legal market,” the letter said. “The unlicensed operators on Weedmaps do not pay taxes or the cost of compliance with local and state regulations, do not follow required worker or consumer protections and do not allow labor unions to organize workers, in turn allowing them to charge a fraction of the cost.” The trade association also called on the state to retroactively impose millions of dollars in fines on Weedmaps under Assembly Bill 97, legislation that passed in July and allows for $30,000 in penalties for each day a cannabis retailer operates without a license. Some have interpreted the law to mean that Weedmaps should also be subject to those fines for allowing unlicensed dispensaries to advertise without a license. Alex Traverso, a spokesman for the Bureau of Cannabis Control, said the agency has been diligent in trying to combat the state’s sprawling illegal marketplace. “The bureau would love to be able to license more cannabis retail locations in California,” he said. “Unfortunately, there are a number of factors that prevent us from doing that. It’s not all under our control. As far as illegal activity is concerned, the bureau will continue its enforcement efforts and continue looking out for the public’s health and well-being.” The agency said this year that it had served 19 search warrants at illegal dispensaries and seized roughly $16.5 million in unregulated cannabis products in the first six months of the year. Both totals were more than the entirety of enforcement actions taken by the agency in 2018. The cannabis bureau also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Weedmaps last year, demanding that the website stop working with unlicensed operators. But Weedmaps has argued in the past that it is protected from such orders under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which has shielded platforms like Facebook and YouTube from responsibility for the content their users post. Late last month, however, Weedmaps said it would stop allowing unlicensed businesses to advertise on its platform, an announcement met with a mixture of praise and skepticism from those who consider the website the bane of California’s legitimate cannabis industry. In a statement issued Wednesday, the company said that in addition to requiring new advertisers to provide a state license number, customers will also need to provide state identification. Despite the effort, Weedmaps Chief Executive Chris Beals said California’s black market would not truly be curtailed until more municipalities allow legal cannabis sales. “While these policy changes will only have a symbolic impact on the size of California’s unlicensed market without more licensing opportunities and other large listing platforms following suit, we want to continue to lead by example,” Beals said in a statement. Less than 20% of cities in California — 89 of 482 — allow retail shops to sell cannabis for recreational use. Though many large cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, allow for the sale of commercial cannabis, even those cities have struggled to curb the black market.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Airbnb pledges $25 million to support affordable housing and small business',\n",
       "  'content': 'Home rental company Airbnb says it will invest $25 million toward affordable housing and other community needs, the latest plan by tech firms to ease a housing crisis their rapid growth has helped exacerbate. Airbnb said the money would be split between Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area, the state’s largest urban centers, where residents are grappling with sky-high housing costs and a surge in homelessness. In addition to the preservation or creation of below-market rental housing, Airbnb said it would direct funding toward promoting homeownership for low- to moderate-income households, financing “meaningful infrastructure initiatives” through municipal bonds and supporting small businesses through loans. “These investments have the potential to generate solid returns for our company and make communities stronger,” Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky said in a statement. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has called on tech companies to support affordable housing, said in a statement Airbnb’s investment was “a critical first step on behalf of their community, and we need more businesses to follow their lead.” Given the scale of the housing crisis, the money is unlikely to go far. Affordable-housing developers use a variety of financing sources to get a project off the ground. But using one gauge of the cost to build affordable housing in California, $25 million would be enough to build 76 new homes. Airbnb acknowledged the money wasn’t huge but said if the investments were successful, the company might expand the pilot program, directing more resources to “projects that support families and communities throughout California and across the country.” California is among areas with the most pressing need. Since 2012, the median home price has soared nearly 80% to $548,600 while the average rent for a vacant apartment is up 42% to $2,288, according to Zillow. Many economists blame the swift rise on cities and residents who fight new development and block builders from constructing enough homes to meet demand from population and job growth. Several recent studies have also found rising rents in high-cost areas lead to increased homelessness, tipping already at-risk people into the streets. Tech firms have drawn criticism for not doing enough to mitigate the effects on communities of their rapid expansion.  Beyond the Bay Area, well-paid tech workers have put upward pressure on rents and home prices on Los Angeles’ Westside as Venice and Playa Vista have morphed into the tech hub known as Silicon Beach. Earlier this year, Newsom said he was meeting with Silicon Valley executives about contributing $500 million to provide developers with low-interest loans to help build housing for middle-income residents. That money has failed to materialize, but Chesky said Airbnb’s investment was inspired by the governor’s leadership. Other companies have also made their own announcements, separate from the middle-income plan. Google, for example, said in June it would lease $750 million worth of its land to developers to build at least 15,000 homes and launch a $250-million investment fund to provide incentive for developers to build at least 5,000 affordable housing units. Microsoft has also announced investments in the Seattle area, while the personal philanthropic company of Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has directed tens of millions to support affordable housing in the Bay Area. Unlike other companies, which have contributed to the housing crisis indirectly through the growth of their well-paid workforces, Airbnb has been accused of exacerbating the home shortage as part of its business model. The company, through its online platform, allows people to rent out rooms or entire apartments to travelers on a nightly basis.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'News Analysis:Apple’s Arcade video game service seeks to upend another business model',\n",
       "  'content': 'Of the refreshed or new products that Apple Inc. talked about at its extravaganza this week, I’m most curious about Arcade, the $5 monthly subscription to video games for iPhones and iPads. The success of Arcade hinges on Apple’s ability to upend an established model for what are known as casual mobile games. These diversions — think Pokemon Go or Clash of Clans rather than lavish Xbox or PlayStation video games — tend to be free to download and play. The companies make money by showing advertisements in the games or persuading users to buy digital trinkets like an advanced virtual weapon. In short, Apple wants people to pay $5 a month for the types of games they have been getting for free, but without ads or in-app purchases. The proposition makes Arcade an intriguing test of Apple’s capability to reshape an industry, consumer behavior and pricing models. (Other companies, including Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox and Google, have or are trying to create subscription models, but for higher-end games.) Apple being Apple, this just might work — or not. Among the Apple watchers on Wall Street, no one seems confident the company can make a mobile-game subscription work, but few predict it will fail. That makes Arcade the get-out-the-popcorn tech product of the moment. Apple has a generally deserved reputation for transforming consumer behavior or making niche behaviors mainstream. Apple made it commonplace to interact with computers with a mouse and a graphical representation of a desk. Apple wasn’t the first company to chop records up into digital files like MP3s, but it got the music industry on board with the idea and made song downloads easy and appealing for everyone. Today, I’m not sure Apple can shape people’s habits at will. Yes, tens of millions of people subscribe to Apple Music, but Spotify had already persuaded music executives and many millions of consumers to embrace streaming. It doesn’t seem as if Apple has persuaded many people on the merits of a subscription to digital news publications. Apple executives scarcely mention the 6-month-old Apple News+, other than to acknowledge that it exists.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'The beloved family-owned Broguiere’s Farm Fresh Dairy in Montebello may be finally closing after serving fresh milk in iconic glass bottles for nearly 100 years. “Closed until further notice” signs reportedly appeared at the dairy’s drive-thru milk stand on Maple Avenue this week following a saga of will-they-or-won’t-they closure rumors that began in late May when the supermarket chain Gelson’s announced that the dairy was permanently shutting down and that the market no longer would receive shipments of its milk. Although the dairy never made an official statement regarding its future, owner Ray Broguiere Jr. told NBC-TV Channel 4 in May that high costs and strict state regulations were the driving forces behind the decision to close. The news ushered in an outpouring of support from customers who flooded the milk stand to buy out their glass bottles and pleaded on social media to keep the operation going. In response, Broguiere Jr. told KCET-TV Channel 28 in June that he was exploring options that would keep the dairy alive. But last week, customers began posting to the dairy’s Facebook page, noting that Broguiere’s products were missing from local stores. Commenters said signs appeared Monday alerting visitors that the business was closed for the foreseeable future. The dairy also is listed as closed on Yelp. Whether the decision is final is unclear. Neither the dairy nor Broguiere Jr. have responded to repeated requests by The Times since initial reports of the closure in May. “I’m so sorry for this loss for the community of Montebello,” wrote one Facebook commenter from Orange who said Wednesday they were first introduced to the milk in 1994. “In my entire life I had never tasted milk so fresh and clean. ... But now I’m at a loss of words to hear I will not be able to buy it ever again. ... May we always have the memory of pouring that delicious milk out of your famous glass bottle.” Sometimes when I wander, the newsroom benefits. I brought back chocolate milk and OJ from Broguiere’s.

       " {'title': 'Trump tells donors in Beverly Hills: ‘We’ll never be a socialist country’',\n",
       "  'content': 'President Trump headlined a Beverly Hills fundraiser Tuesday night at the mansion of Los Angeles developer Geoffrey Palmer, according to sources familiar with the event. The dinner was the second stop of a two-day swing through California that is expected to raise more than $15 million for the president’s reelection campaign. “It was absolutely awesome. People are ready and committed to working very hard for his reelection,” said Celeste Greig, a veteran GOP activist who attended the dinner, where filet mignon and sea bass were served. Greig,the former president of the California Republican Assembly, said Trump spoke about his efforts to end child trafficking, stop illegal immigration, create stronger trade relations and take on the crop of Democratic candidates competing to replace him. “We will never be a socialist country,” Trump said, according to Greig. The president was joined at the event by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, son Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend, former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle (who is also California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ex-wife). Donors, who were not told the exact location of the fundraiser, checked in at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where they showed their credentials before being whisked to Palmer’s mansion in shuttles. Actor and Trump critic Tom Arnold was at the hotel trolling Trump supporters as they arrived, Greig said. Earlier in the day, Trump spoke at a Bay Area luncheon at the 32,000-square-foot home of Sun Microsystems cofounder Scott McNealy. Harmeet Dhillon, one of California’s two representatives on the Republican National Committee, rode with the president in his car from Moffett Federal Airfield to McNealy’s Portola Valley home. “We spoke about California and legal issues. He asked about various things going on in California, [notably] the homelessness issue and how concerned he is about the health crisis, in Southern California in particular,” said Dhillon, a San Francisco attorney whom Trump has recognized at the White House for her work on behalf of conservatives on college campuses and in Silicon Valley.  Dhillon sponsored four tables at the luncheon and said she had to turn away more than 50 people who wanted to attend. “Everyone in the room was a supporter, and everyone to a man and woman left feeling positive and energized,” Dhillon said. California is a conundrum for Republicans — though it is overwhelmingly Democratic, it is a major source of Republican campaign dollars. Trump lost California by 30 points to Hillary Clinton, but he received nearly 4.5 million votes and raised $333.1 million in the state for his 2016 campaign committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump spoke for nearly an hour at McNealy’s home as 400 supporters gathered beneath a tent dined on salmon salad and gazpacho. Then he headed to Los Angeles, where veteran GOP activist Shawn Steel was among those who greeted him on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport. “He told us he’s coming back. We want him to come back, not only for raising money but for rallies,” said Steel, an RNC member whose wife, Michelle Steel, is on the Orange County Board of Supervisors and is running for Congress. GOP losses in Orange County last year were among the reasons the Republican Party ceded control of the House of Representatives. “He asked, ‘How are we doing in California? I understand it’s tough.’ I said it’s a lot better than three years ago, and secondly we have a whole new slate of candidates from the suburbs, a lot of women, a lot of minorities, a lot of immigrants,” Steel said. “He liked the sound of that.” Trumpspent his evening with hundreds of donors at Palmer’s mansion. Tickets started at $1,000 for individual dinner seats and went up to $100,000 per couple, which included a roundtable with the president, a photo opportunity, VIP reception and priority seating at the dinner, according to an invitation. The money will be split among Trump’s reelection committee as well as the Republican National Committee and state GOP groups. The Beverly Hills fundraiser caused a flap in Hollywood when its details first emerged. “Will and Grace” actress Debra Messing tweeted, “Please print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know.” Critics charged that Messing and fellow actors were in effect calling for a McCarthy-like blacklist, and the president denounced Messing on Twitter.'},\n",

       " {'title': 'Fatal shooting by officer at 24 Hour Fitness violated LAPD policy, Police Commission rules',\n",
       "  'content': 'A police officer violated department policy when he fatally shot a man in a locker room at a 24 Hour Fitness gym in Hollywood, the Los Angeles Police Commission ruled Tuesday. The commission’s decision contradicted LAPD Chief Michel Moore’s assessment that the shots fired by the officer on Oct. 29, 2018, were justified. However, both Moore and the commission found that the officer and his partner should have de-escalated the situation by backing off and requesting help before attempting to handcuff the man, Albert Ramon Dorsey. The vote was 4-0, with Commissioner Sandra Figueroa-Villa absent. “By not observing the warning signs of a potentially violent suspect, the officers acted too quickly and placed themselves at a tactical disadvantage during the incident,” Moore wrote in his report. After failing to handcuff Dorsey, both officers tased him, according to the report. One officer, identified earlier by the LAPD as Edward Agdeppa, fired his gun at Dorsey five times because Dorsey was standing over his partner and punching her repeatedly in the face, the report said. In emotional testimony before the five-member civilian Police Commission, Dorsey’s sister, Sonya Smith, described her brother as a “gentle giant” with a big heart who took care of a handicapped sibling. She accused the officers of feeling threatened by Dorsey because “he was big and black.” Dorsey, 30, owned a car detailing business and had moved to L.A. from Maryland two weeks before his death to try to make it as a rapper.  Smith read letters from people who remembered Dorsey as a hard worker who sang while he polished cars, was unfailingly polite and could strike up a conversation with anyone. The fatal encounter began with a 911 call from the 24 Hour Fitness on Sunset Boulevard about a naked man who was refusing to leave and had assaulted customers and security officers. Agdeppa and his partner, who has not been identified by the LAPD, found Dorsey in a locker room undressed and toweling himself dry. According to footage from the officers’ body cameras released by the LAPD, Dorsey did not obey the officers’ requests to put on his clothes and leave the gym. Dorsey asked the officers what the problem was. They replied that he was causing a disturbance but did not elaborate. Agdeppa quickly became exasperated, muttering “Jesus Christ” to himself. As he pulled on black gloves, Agdeppa said under his breath, using a profanity, “I do not have time for this.” He then said to Dorsey: “Are you going to get dressed? Or are we going to have to drag you out of here like this?” As both officers shouted at Dorsey to put his clothes on, he began dancing to  hip hop music coming from his phone. After Dorsey pointed his middle finger at the officers, Agdeppa grabbed his arms and attempted to handcuff him. A struggle ensued, with the officers cursing and repeatedly yelling at Dorsey to stop tensing up. Both officers’ body cameras fell off early in the struggle. “If you want, we can all get along,” Dorsey said at one point. There is audio but no video of the officers tasing Dorsey, then gunshots echoing across the locker room. According to the LAPD, Dorsey was 6 feet 1  and 280 pounds, while Agdeppa was 5 feet 1 and the female officer was 5 feet 5. Moore cited the size differential as one reason why the officers should not have confronted Dorsey on their own. According to Moore’s report, the officers told LAPD investigators that their Tasers had no effect on Dorsey, who grabbed the female officer’s Taser and punched her in the face. Agdeppa said his partner was crouched in a fetal position and trying to cover her face as Dorsey threw “massive punches at high velocity” with handcuffs partially attached to his wrist. Agdeppa told investigators that he shot Dorsey to stop his partner from being seriously injured or killed. “If I even waited any longer, that next punch could have been the deadly one,” the officer said. “And I did not want to take that chance.” Moore determined that Agdeppa’s decision to use lethal force was reasonable, since Dorsey was engaged in a prolonged physical struggle with the officers, the Taser did not incapacitate him and he was hitting the female officer in the head while trying to grab her Taser. After deliberating in closed session, the Police Commission came to a different conclusion on the shots fired by Agdeppa, which hit Dorsey multiple times in the torso. The LAPD documented injuries to both officers: The female officer had swelling and bruising on her face, while Agdeppa suffered a broken nose. Smith told the commission that she had watched the video and thought her brother’s behavior seemed reasonable. He just wanted to finish showering and dressing at his own pace, she said. “They tried in no way to call for backup,” she said of the officers. “His life was taken senselessly. That was a brutal and hateful murder.”'},\n",
       " {'title': 'A project could bring South L.A. hundreds of new homes. But critics fear rising rents',\n",
       "  'content': 'The real estate project known as District Square has had a decadelong run of bad luck. Construction of the project in South Los Angeles has been repeatedly delayed. The developers, who were provided millions of dollars in federal loans, have received multiple default notices from the city. And Arman Gabay, one of the businessmen who conceived the project, was arrested last year on bribery and wire fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty. District Square’s fortunes could turn around on Tuesday, when the South Los Angeles Area Planning Commission is scheduled to take up the 577-unit residential project. But the six-story development still faces a key obstacle: activists who are frustrated that the developers have not set aside any units as affordable for low-income families. “We’d have issues with any project ... that has this many market-rate units in a community that’s low income,” said Damien Goodmon, executive director of the Crenshaw Subway Coalition, a group focused on fighting gentrification. “But the fact that there are no affordable units is even more egregious.” Goodmon contends that District Square, which is planned at the corner of Crenshaw and Obama boulevards, will inspire other landlords to increase their rents, forcing out black and Latino households. If the commission signs off on the project, Council President Herb Wesson should take it up on the council floor and ensure that affordable housing is built at that location, Goodmon said. Edward Johnson, a Wesson spokesman, had no comment Monday when contacted by The Times. Stacey Brenner, who is listed in city documents as a consultant for developer Mark Gabay and the company District Square LLC, did not respond to multiple messages. Planning officials, for their part, have informed the commission that they do not expect any displacement, since District Square is slated to be built on an empty lot. “There is no substantial evidence that the approval of the project resulted in intentional discrimination against a protected class of low-income residents,” officials from the planning department said in their report to the commission. City officials have determined that District Square is exempt from the state’s environmental law, in large part because it’s near an Expo light rail station and complies with specific planning rules for the surrounding neighborhood. Goodmon and one of the project’s neighbors have submitted an appeal of the planning department’s decision to the area planning commission, which is made up of appointees of Mayor Eric Garcetti. The debate over District Square comes six months after the City Council approved a 725-unit residential project in Chinatown that had no affordable units. Renters rights’ groups opposed that development, saying it would spur other landlords in that neigbhorhood to increase rents in their own buildings. Cynthia Strathmann, executive director of the tenant advocacy group Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, said South Los Angeles does need more housing — but at a price that residents can afford. A project filled exclusively with market-rate apartments “can drive up rents and have an indirect displacement effect and make housing even less affordable for people in the community,” she said. Despite those concerns, business leaders along the Crenshaw Corridor have lined up behind District Square. Armen D. Ross, president and chief executive of the Crenshaw Chamber of Commerce, said it will create a new gathering place on the boulevard and help the area benefit from the staging of the Olympic Games in L.A. in 2028. District Square “certainly will become a cultural destination attraction,” Ross wrote in a letter to the city.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Chinese mom charged with paying $400,000 to have son admitted to UCLA as fake soccer player',\n",
       "  'content': 'A Chinese woman was arrested in Spain and charged with paying the mastermind of the college admissions scandal $400,000 to ensure her son was admitted to UCLA as a phony soccer player, federal authorities in Boston said Tuesday. Xiaoning Sui — a Chinese national and resident of British Columbia — was arrested by Spanish authorities Monday night, according to the U.S. attorney’s office in Massachusetts, which is seeking Sui’s extradition. Sui, the 35th parent to be charged in the college admissions scandal, has been indicted on one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and honest services mail fraud. To guarantee her son a spot at UCLA, prosecutors say Sui turned to William “Rick” Singer, the Newport Beach college admissions consultant who earlier this year admitted to overseeing a sprawling, decade-long scheme that defrauded some of the country’s most selective universities with rigged college entrance exams, fake recruiting profiles and six-figure bribes to college coaches and administrators. Sui, 48, paid Singer $400,000 to have her son admitted to UCLA as a recruited soccer player, despite that the boy  had not played the sport competitively, according to an indictment returned by a grand jury in March. The indictment was sealed until Sui’s arrest. The Times reported Sui’s alleged deal with Singer last month. It wasn’t clear Tuesday whether Sui had retained a lawyer. The indictment lays out Sui’s alleged deal with Singer, beginning in August 2018, when Singer discussed with a college tennis recruiter from Sarasota, Fla., how much it would cost Sui to guarantee her son’s admission to several universities “through bribery.” The recruiter, described as owning a business that matches high school tennis players with college coaches, isn’t named in the indictment, but several people familiar with the case identified him as Scott Treibly. Treibly, a former college tennis coach and former administrator at IMG Academy, didn’t respond to requests for comment. He hasn’t been charged in the case. Singer has pleaded guilty to four felonies and is awaiting sentencing. Singer, Treibly, Sui and a Chinese translator had a conference call in August 2018, the indictment says, in which Singer told Sui he would need to write her son’s application “in a special way” to guarantee his admission to UCLA. Federal agents had by then been recording Singer’s phone calls for months. Singer told Sui to place $400,000 in an escrow account, which would hold the money until her son was admitted to UCLA, according to the indictment. He told Sui her son wouldn’t “know anything is happening,” the indictment says. Two weeks later, Sui sent pictures of her son playing tennis to Treibly, who forwarded them to Singer, the indictment says. Singer then sent them to Laura Janke, a former USC assistant soccer coach, telling her, “This young man will be a soccer player from Vancouver for UCLA.” Janke has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering, and admitted crafting scores of bogus recruiting profiles for the children of Singer’s clients. Janke created one such profile for Sui’s son, the indictment says, complete with pictures of a different person playing soccer and fake achievements that described the boy as “a top player for two private soccer clubs in Canada.” Singer sent the recruiting profile and transcripts to Jorge Salcedo, UCLA’s head men’s soccer coach at the time, prosecutors allege. Salcedo forwarded the transcripts to “UCLA athletics administrators in order to process the recruitment of [Sui’s son] as a UCLA soccer player,” the indictment says. “The UCLA admissions office typically allocates a number of admissions slots to each head coach to recruit highly qualified athletes,” prosecutors wrote in the indictment. “Being on a UCLA head coach’s list of recruited athletes significantly increases an applicant’s chance of being admitted.” Salcedo was indicted in March, charged with facilitating a similar deal in 2016. Prosecutors allege Singer paid him $100,000 to misrepresent the daughter of a wealthy Bay Area couple, Bruce and Davina Isackson, as a soccer recruit. The couple pleaded guilty earlier this year and admitted their daughter didn’t play soccer. Salcedo has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering. His attorney didn’t respond to a request for comment. In another conference call with Treibly, Sui and a translator, Singer told Sui to wire him $100,000, which he explained in English would be paid to “the UCLA men’s soccer coach directly,” the indictment says. The translator told Sui, according to the indictment: “Your son is admitted to this school through UCLA’s soccer team. That $100,000 is directly transferred to that soccer coach. So, although your son is a tennis player, because there is a place in [the] soccer team, so it is the soccer team that takes your son.” “OK,” Sui said, according to the indictment. Singer had by then been apprehended and was cooperating with federal authorities. He mailed a $100,000 check to Salcedo and a $25,000 check to Ali Khosroshahin, a former USC women’s soccer coach who helped arrange the deals with Salcedo, prosecutors say. Khosroshahin pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit racketeering. UCLA approved Sui’s son for admission as a recruited soccer player with a 25% athletic scholarship, the indictment says. He signed a letter of intent to play soccer at UCLA in November 2018. His mother wired Singer $300,000 in February, according to the indictment. Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for UCLA, said in a statement the school took “immediate corrective action” after Salcedo and 49 others were charged in connection with Singer’s scheme in March. Tamberg said he was prevented by law and school policy from discussing the specifics of Sui’s case, but added that UCLA “can revoke the admission and athletics scholarship offer of any admitted student or dismiss any enrolled student who is found to have misrepresented information on their application.” UCLA isn’t aware of any “currently enrolled student-athletes” being investigated by federal prosecutors, Tamberg said.

       " {'title': 'Column:In shocking reversal, Big Business puts the shareholder value myth in the grave',\n",
       "  'content': 'Among the developments followers of business ethics may have thought they’d never see, the end of the shareholder value myth has to rank very high. Yet one of America’s leading business lobbying groups just buried the myth. “We share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,” reads a statement issued Monday by the Business Roundtable and signed by 181 CEOs. (Emphasis in the original.) The statement mentions, in order, customers, employees, suppliers, communities and — dead last — shareholders. The corporate commitment to all these stakeholders may be largely rhetorical at the moment, but it’s hard to overstate what a reversal the statement represents from the business community’s preexisting viewpoint. Since the 1970s, the prevailing ethos of corporate management has been that a company’s prime responsibility — effectively, its only responsibility — is to serve its shareholders. Benefits for those other stakeholders follow, but they’re not the prime concern. “In the Business Roundtable’s view, the paramount duty of management and of boards of directors is to the corporation’s stockholders; the interests of other stakeholders are relevant as a derivative of the duty to stockholders,” the organization declared in 1997. The Roundtable assembled impressive firepower behind its reformulation, which bears the title, “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.” Among its signatories are Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase and the Roundtable’s chairman; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; Tim Cook of Apple; Ginni Rometty of IBM; Mary Barra of General Motors; and the heads of major drug companies, banks, retailers, utilities and insurance companies. There’s no need to consult a  who’s who to determine the royalty of American business — they’re here. The statement may reflect a sea change in the attitude of Big Business CEOs to challenges to their management principle coming from social organizations and especially from some candidates for the Democratic nomination for president, notably Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. It may also represent a recognition that the federal government, once an agent of social transformation, is not currently playing that role. If issues such as income and wealth inequality, climate change and racial discrimination are going to be addressed, corporate America will have to step up to the plate. “Stakeholders are pushing companies to wade into sensitive social and political issues — especially as they see governments failing to do so effectively,” Larry Fink, the chairman and chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock and a signer of the Roundtable letter, wrote this year in his annual letter to chief executives of the firms in which BlackRock invests. “As divisions continue to deepen,” Fink continued, “companies must demonstrate their commitment to the countries, regions, and communities where they operate, particularly on issues central to the world’s future prosperity.” Dimon, meanwhile, said in his annual letter to shareholders: “In the past, boards and advisors to boards advised company CEOs to keep their head down and stay out of the line of fire.” But “things have changed. ... If companies and CEOs do not get involved in public policy issues, making progress on all these problems may be more difficult.” But it’s proper to approach the Roundtable statement cautiously. “We are skeptical about what the CEO signatories to this statement have in mind,” ValueEdge Advisors, a leading critic of corporate governance practices, said in its own statement Monday. “Everything will depend on how specifically and quantifiably they describe their stakeholder goals and especially how their compensation is tied to those goals. If pay is exclusively or primarily based on stock price, this statement is just an attempt at distraction. Investors should insist on more specifics and more clarity.” The pernicious notion that a corporation exists solely to “maximize shareholder wealth” was most effectively codified by the conservative economist Milton Friedman in a 1970 essay. Friedman declared that business leaders who spoke up for the social responsibility of their corporations were “preaching pure and unadulterated socialism.” Friedman dismissed out of hand the notion that business should “take seriously its responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers.” Chief executives who harbored such unorthodox thoughts were “unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades,” he wrote.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'Who is Javier Burillo Azcarraga, the Mexican tycoon arrested after son’s boat death?',\n",
       "  'content': 'He inherited one of the most famous names in Mexico. Javier Burillo Azcarraga’s grandfather founded the company that would become Grupo Televisa, the world’s largest Spanish-language entertainment company. Burillo would go on to marry a former Mexican president’s daughter in 1989 and over the years make a name for himself developing luxury resorts in Mexico. But on Sunday, the 57-year-old was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter with a vessel, willful harm or injury to a child and operating a boat while under the influence after his 11-year-old son died on a boating trip in San Francisco Bay. Records show Burillo was released Monday afternoon on $1-million bond. The Marin County district attorney’s office said Tuesday that the case  was still being reviewed. Although police identified him as Javier A. Burillo, property records reviewed by the Associated Press show Burillo’s full name is Javier Burillo Azcarraga, a wealthy developer with ties to one of the most powerful families in Mexico. The Azcarraga family founded the Mexican network Grupo Televisa, an international media leader that produces Spanish-language programming throughout Latin America. Over several decades, the media conglomerate has dominated in television, publishing and radio broadcasting. According to Univision, Burillo owns several restaurants, hotels and high-end resorts in Mexico, including in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Property records also show that Burillo’s Marin County home was purchased in 2004 for $10.2 million and that he and his wife, Rose, own properties in San Diego and Sausalito, according to the Associated Press. Although any professional involvement between Burillo and Televisa is unclear, the Marin Independent Journal reports that divorce court filings show Burillo has nontaxable income of $176,000 per month from family sources. “Javier is a member of an extraordinarily and politically powerful family in Mexico,” Rose wrote in a court filing seeking child support. Javier Burillo Azcarraga is listed on public genealogy websites as the grandson of Emilio Azcarraga Vidaurreta, as reported by a Univision station.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'California Republican Rep. Paul Cook to retire from Congress, run for county supervisor seat',\n",
       "  'content': 'Rep. Paul Cook (R-Yucca Valley) will retire from Congress at the end of his term and has announced a run for a seat on the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, according to John Sobel, the congressman’s chief of staff.  Cook is the first to announce his retirement in California’s Republican U.S. House delegation, which has been greatly diminished in recent years. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats took control of half of the 14 remaining Republican seats in California, which has a total of 53 congressional districts. “Serving in Congress has been an absolute honor, and I’m proud of my numerous victories amid a tough partisan atmosphere,” Cook said in a press release. “Our high desert needs continued strong leadership at the county level, and I pledge to fight for this area with the same dedication and conviction I’ve demonstrated my entire career.” Cook’s departure from the 8th Congressional District will mark the latest in a series of  House Republican retirements as the lawmakers confront life in the minority. In all, more than a dozen GOP members have announced plans to leave Congress after 2020, including several in Texas. Cook was mayor of Yucca Valley and served in the state Assembly before being elected to Congress in 2012. He plans to announce a run to represent the 1st District of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, a district that does not include his Yucca Valley home. Robert Lovingood, who currently holds the seat, recently announced he won’t seek reelection. The four-term congressman is not the first to seek a return to local office after leaving Capitol Hill. In 2015, Janice Hahn announced she would leave Congress to run for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis was elected to the county board after eight years in Congress and a stint as U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Obama. Republicans hold a lead of  4 percentage points in voter registration in the district, which stretches from Mono County to San Bernardino County along the Nevada border. But despite Democrats’ recent interest in making inroads in the district, it’s been long known as a deeply conservative area. President Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by more than 15 percentage points, besting  Mitt Romney’s 2012 margin in the district, and Cook won his last reelection fight against a fellow Republican with 60% of the vote. Cook, not known as a prolific fundraiser in Congress, was out-raised by Democrat Christine Bubser in the quarter ending June 30 — she brought in $204,800 to Cook’s $139,299. Bubser is the only Democrat who’d filed to challenge Cook in 2020.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'The Sports Report: Recapping a busy day in the world of sports',\n",
       "  'content': 'Howdy, my name is Houston Mitchell. Saturday was a busy day for sports fans, so let’s put aside the wise guy comments and get right to what happened. Dodgers The Dodgers lost twice on Saturday. First they lost pitcher Julio Urias to a 20-game suspension, then they lost to the Atlanta Braves, 4-3. Before the game, Urias accepted a 20-game suspension stemming from his May arrest on suspicion of misdemeanor domestic battery. The suspension includes the five games Urias missed while on administrative leave, effectively making it a 15-game, unpaid ban. “Since May, I have been fully cooperating with both law enforcement and MLB,” Urias said in a statement released by the players assn. “Although the authorities determined no charges of any kind were warranted, I accept full responsibility for what I believe was my inappropriate conduct during the incident. “Even in this instance where there was no injury or history of violence, I understand and agree that Major League players should be held to a higher standard. I hold myself to a higher standard as well.” And when you really look at it, Urias pitched three innings on Friday, so he wasn’t going to pitch for 3-4 days anyway. That effectively means it is an 11-game suspension. All of this really means it’s only a little worse than the Dodgers putting him on the 10-day IL. UFC Daniel Cormier lost the heavyweight title to Stipe Miocic at UFC 241. Here’s the round-by-round recap by Todd Martin. You can read a recap of each fight, including the Nate Diaz-Anthony Pettis fight, by clicking here. Daniel Cormier was the UFC light heavyweight champion when he moved up to fight for the UFC heavyweight title and he knocked out Miocic to add that title as well. Now he defends against the former champion looking to further bolster his impressive resume. Before losing to Cormier, Miocic was the only UFC heavyweight champion to successfully defend the title three times and he is looking to regain his perch. Round 1. Cormier lands a hard leg kick at the start. Cormier adds two more leg kicks. Cormier fakes a takedown and throws a punch that doesn’t land. Cormier lands a three punch combination and then a two punch combination while Miocic still hasn’t let his hands go. Cormier cracks Miocic with a left hook. Cormier lifts up Miocic and slams him down. Cormier lands some punches from the top and Miocic isn’t able to do much from the guard on the bottom. Miocic looks to stand up in the final 30 seconds. Cormier lands punch after punch in the process. 10-8 Cormier. Round 2. Miocic throws a few jabs to start and a knee. Miocic lands a nice uppercut. Cormier lands an elbow. They trade heavy punches from close range. Miocic connects with a hard right cross. Cormier answers with a big right hand of his own. They’re both connecting with big shots and it feels like either man could go down from the right punch. Working to Cormier’s advantage is that they’re fighting in close range where Miocic’s reach advantage doesn’t come into play. Miocic stuns Cormier with a late left hand. Close round. 10-9 Cormier. Round 3. Miocic knocks Cormier back with a straight right hand early. Miocic looks for a takedown but doesn’t come close. Cormier lands a series of straight punches to the right eye. Miocic is clearly having trouble seeing with that eye and so Cormier targets it even more. Miocic gets a takedown with a minute and a half left but Cormier gets back up. Cormier cracks Miocic with three hard punches in the final minute. Another close round. 10-9 Cormier. Round 4. Miocic lands a jab and Cormier retaliates with a leaping hook that connects more solidly. After two action packed rounds in the second and third, the pace has slowed on both ends. Miocic is repeatedly attacking the body with punches. He’s landing one left hand to the body after another. Miocic follows a left to the body with a right to the head. He stuns Cormier with a right hand and knocks him out with punches up against the cage. Winner: Stipe Miocic, KO, round 4. Daniel Cormier appeared to be getting the better of that fight most of the way but Miocic adjusted in the fourth round. He punished Cormier to the body and then finished him to the head. It’s another great win for one of the best heavyweights of all time. Cormier has nothing to be ashamed of; he largely fought a winning fight and he was in there with an excellent opponent who has some natural physical advantages. Rams For a team that gave its star running back a massive contract extension before last season, and in March matched an offer sheet to re-sign his backup, the Rams made another relatively significant investment in April when they selected running back Darrell Henderson in the third round of the NFL draft. Henderson started Saturday and was used as a runner and receiver in the Rams’ 14-10 loss to the Dallas Cowboys in a preseason game in Honolulu. Henderson started fast, catching a third-down pass on the right side and turning it into a 26-yard gain during the first series. He played three series in the first quarter, and was in for a few situational plays in the second before returning for a two-minute drive at the end of the half. He finished the half with 12 touches, rushing for 16 yards in six carries and catching six passes for 38 yards. Coach Sean McVay is not playing starters or key rotational players during the preseason to ensure that they are physically sound for the Sept. 8 opener against the Carolina Panthers. Chargers Derwin James, the Chargers’ All-Pro safety, will undergo surgery next week to repair a stress fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his right foot. James has been told he’ll need a recovery time of three to four months. Based on that projection, he’ll be out at least until mid-November. The Chargers play Kansas City in Mexico City on Nov. 18 during Week 11. Angels Mike Trout singled to left field in the seventh inning, driving in two runs in a key four-run rally that lifted the Angels to a 6-5 win over the Chicago White Sox. Angels left-hander Jose Suarez pitched and made a step forward in his battle to stop tipping his pitches. Suarez gave up 14 earned runs and 21 hits, including five homers, in 121/3 innings of his previous three starts, losses to Detroit, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. Coaches noticed after a June 20 start in Toronto that Suarez was changing his glove position depending on which pitch he was preparing to throw. A thorough review of his last three starts convinced them Suarez was tipping his pitches. “He’s gone through a couple of delivery iterations because he was giving away pitches,” manager Brad Ausmus said. “It wasn’t so much the stuff itself as it was that hitters do better when they know what’s coming. We have confirmation that he was tipping. Hopefully that’s cleaned up.” Galaxy The Galaxy played a tough game against Seattle and were down a man most of the match, but kept their composure to come away with a 2-2 draw. They could have come away with the win, but a strange own goal in the 82nd minute cost them. “I feel very proud about the players, the team, because they fought,” Galaxy coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto said. “They deserved more than one point.” With Seattle growing desperate in the closing minutes, the Sounders launched a long ball over the top that forced Galaxy keeper David Bingham to come more than 30 yards off his line. Bingham got to the ball first and tried to punch it out of danger, but it struck defender Jorgen Skjelvik in the head and caromed into the net. LAFC Carlos Vela scored his MLS-leading 24th goal of the season, Tyler Miller had four saves and Los Angeles FC beat Real Salt Lake 2-0 to clinch a playoff berth. LAFC played a man down after defender Walker Zimmerman was given a red card for unsporting behavior in the 48th minute. Vela, whose 15 assists are tied with Diego Valeri of the Portland Timbers for the league lead, broke the MLS record for combined goals and assists. Sebastian Giovinco had 22 goals and 16 assists for Toronto FC in 2015. USC football The decision on who will start for the Trojans at quarterback this season appears imminent. USC coach Clay Helton and his new offensive coordinator, Graham Harrell, will evaluate the scrimmage tape of all four quarterbacks on Monday. It has seemed all but certain through a dozen practices that JT Daniels will reprise his role as USC’s starter. The sophomore led the first drive Saturday, followed by freshman Kedon Slovis, then redshirt junior Matt Fink, and finally, sophomore Jack Sears. “I’ll be honest with you, I’ve never had four quarterbacks that could start on a lot of football teams across the country,” Helton said. “All have played at a high level. [The competition] has really progressed everybody. I’m so glad we’ve done this.” Horse racing Higher Power won the $1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar and the top three horses — Higher Power, Draft Pick and Mongolian Groom — were all locally based. “It developed pretty much the way we thought,” trainer John Sadler said. “We thought there would be some speed on the inside and the plan was to stalk. It came out the way we thought it would.” Quip, based in Kentucky, went to the early lead but then gave way entering the far turn. That’s when jockey Flavien Prat started to move Higher Power and he had a 3½-length lead when he entered the stretch. The winning margin was 5¼ lengths. Higher Power paid $21.20, $9.40 and $7.40. From fourth place, the remainder of the field was Tenfold, Campaign, War Story, the favorite Seeking the Soul, Pavel, Quip and For The Top. “We were in good shape all the way around,” Prat said. “At the three-eighths pole, I asked, and he took up the bit and went from there. He was traveling well all the way around. I thought he would run a good race [Saturday]. He had been training so well, I thought he would have a good one in him.” High School football Times high school sports columnist Eric Sondheimer is counting down to the season by picking the top players at each position. Today, he moves on to tight end. Take it away, Eric. Running back Anthony Spearman II, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame Spearman projects as a running back to watch this season even though most don’t know what he’s capable of accomplishing on a football field. Last season as a sophomore, he was a featured running back with Christian Grubb, one of the fastest players in the state who ended up signing with UCLA. In Spearman’s second game of the season, he rushed for 108 yards and three touchdowns in nine carries against Moorpark. He had five touchdowns in his first six games. Then he sustained a high ankle sprain against Lake Balboa Birmingham. He pretty much disappeared and was never the same. “I just feel there’s a chip on my shoulder because I didn’t get a lot of credit for what happened last year because I was out most of the year,” he said. “I feel I’ve improved.” Faster, stronger and more confident, the 5-foot-10, 195-pound Spearman is poised for an impact season. Most importantly, he’s healthy. At 16, Spearman has already faced the toughest adversity any teenager can encounter — the loss of a parent. Spearman’s mother, Kathy, died last April at age 41. She had a heart attack after battling diabetes. “It’s still tough, honestly,” he said. “She was my biggest cheerleader. She’d be at every game. She’d be at practice sometimes. She’d be the mom cheering, no matter what. She was the one voice I could always hear.” Top running backs Player, School | Ht. | Wt. | Yr. | Comment Eddie Allain, Norte Vista | 5-10 | 170 | So. | Rushed for 1,550 yards, 23 TDs as a freshman Kevin Armstead, St. Francis | 5-7 | 185 | Sr. | Rushed for 1,097 yards last season Amir Bankhead, Paraclete | 5-9 | 180 | Jr. | Back from injury after gaining 1,311 yards in 2017 Davon Booth, El Monte | 5-8 | 165 | Sr. | Rushed for 2,429 yards, 31 TDs PJ Garcia, Garfield | 5-6 | 170 | Sr. | Had nine games rushing for more than 100 yards Nathaniel Jones, St. John Bosco | 5-11 | 190 | Sr. | UCLA commit is back from injury Jyden King, Calabasas | 6-1 | 205 | Sr. | A Washington State commit with size Damien Moore, Bishop Amat | 5-10 | 190 | Sr. | Cal commit back from injury after great sophomore year Anthony Spearman III, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame | 5-10 | 195 | Jr. | He’s healthy and ready to roll Chris Street, JSerra | 5-11 | 205 | Sr. | Cal commit rushed for 1,342 yards, 17 touchdowns Jakai Torres, St. Bernard | 5-11 | 190 | Sr. | Rushed for 1,770 yards, 24 touchdowns Odds and ends Column: L.A. teams heading to Hawaii to train and play games is the new norm....

       "  'content': 'Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It’s Tuesday, Sept. 17, and I’m writing from Los Angeles. Get the Essential California newsletter » Scholars, pundits and political reporters have long tried to probe the presidential id. Usually, it’s not until well after a leader of the free world has left office that historians can gain access to all the correspondence and primary source materials that might allow for a keyhole into their hidden needs and desires. But this administration is different. On his Twitter feed, President Trump, who has been dubbed the tweeter in chief, offers a near-constant window into his most recent thoughts, wants, grudges and decisions, often in a seemingly unfiltered stream. (Twitter is also where he occasionally fires high-level people and makes impromptu foreign policy.) He has tweeted thousands of times since taking office, and California has been one of the most dominant topics on his feed. The president, who lost the state by more than 4 million votes in 2016, is returning Tuesday to raise money for his reelection campaign. In honor of his visit, our data team worked to compile everything the president has tweeted about the Golden State since taking office in one place, where they could draw some patterns and insight. But first, they needed to define what it even meant to tweet about California. Graphics and data journalist Priya Krishnakumar, who led the project, explained that the group looked beyond references to the word “California” alone and created a broad dictionary of terms that touched on California policies and politicians. (They chose to ignore references to individual celebrities.) The president’s unique tweeting style, which often includes creative spellings and nicknames, brought some challenges. They found that they couldn’t just search for an individual name, like, say, Rep. Adam Schiff, because he might be referred to as “little Adam Schiff” or “Liddle Adam Schiff” or \"#ShiftySchiff” or even “Adam” followed by an expletive that happens to sound a lot like Schiff. These kind of variations in spelling and nomenclature meant they had to sort through and categorize all of the president’s tweets manually, instead of creating some kind of script to do that grunt work for them. They found that the president had tweeted 219 times about California since taking office, with significant upticks in November 2018 (when California Republicans lost several seats in the midterm election and wildfires ripped through the state) and January 2019 (when Trump ramped up attacks on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats). Pelosi, who represents California’s 12th district in San Francisco, garnered more tweets than any other California topic. “It’s not all negative,” Data Desk editor Ben Welsh explained. “He loves to praise Republicans like Rep. Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Devin Nunes. But not as much as he loves to trash Nancy Pelosi.” [Read the story and see all the tweets: “Pelosi, Hollywood and high taxes: Here’s everything Trump has tweeted about California” in the Los Angeles Times] Plus, in news you can use, a quick note on L.A. road closures and the president’s visit. As of late Monday night, the full details of traffic-snarling road closures had yet to be announced. However, KTLA reports that the president will be traveling by motorcade from Santa Monica to Beverly Hills for a 6:30 p.m. fundraiser Tuesday, and then traveling again by motorcade from Beverly Hills to his downtown L.A. lodgings around 8:30 p.m. Angelenos will also want to avoid the area of 7th and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles most of Tuesday and early Wednesday, as an LAPD sergeant tweeted Tuesday night that all streets in and around the area of 7th and Fig will be closed from  noon Tuesday to noon  Wednesday for the visit. “This will affect all traffic in the #DTLA area so plan accordingly,” he added forebodingly.

       " {'title': 'California Gov. Gavin Newsom takes executive action on vaping and e-cigarettes',\n",
       "  'content': 'California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a crackdown on illicit e-cigarettes on Monday and plans to launch a state-sponsored public awareness campaign about the dangers of the devices amid a nationwide outbreak of serious lung illness connected to vaping. Newsom’s executive actions instruct state regulators to “reduce youth vaping consumption” by finding ways to ban illegal and counterfeit vaping products. The Democratic governor also set aside $20 million for a  vaping awareness campaign and instructed state health officials to develop signs warning against the hazards of vaping to be placed at retailers and on advertising for e-cigarettes and accessories. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that there  have been at least six deaths and 450 possible cases of severe lung illnesses related to vaping across the country since the first cases were reported in April. Public health officials have urged people to stop vaping until they can determine the cause of the illness. “We’ve seen a skyrocket increase in the use of these flavored products by our children,” Newsom told reporters during a morning news conference. “As a father of four, this has been an issue that’s been brought to the forefront of my consciousness.”  The director of the Vaping Technology Assn., which represents manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of vaping products, said he supported Newsom’s call for cracking down on youth access to e-cigarettes. “We stand ready to work with the governor and interested stakeholders on thoughtful and effective laws and regulations that restrict youth access and do not unfairly advantage combustible cigarettes,” Tony Abboud said in a statement Monday evening. “We also stand ready to work with the governor to allow legal and responsible vape small business owners the ability to continue to operate in a regulated market selling to adult consumers who rely on their access to these life-changing products.” Newsom said he supports banning all flavored vaping products, but has been advised that he does not have  the legal authority to do so without legislative action. The governor said he plans to work with state lawmakers next year to outlaw the products. Jim Knox, director of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in California, said he was disappointed that Newsom’s executive action didn’t go further by imposing an immediate ban, but he was encouraged by the governor’s vow to seek one. “These proposals are helpful. It’s encouraging that the governor has recognized this as public health crisis and understands the need to do something about it,” Knox said. “We know what’s driving this crisis. It’s flavored tobacco. We have to get flavored tobacco off store shelves.”  The governor’s action came a few days after the Legislature adjourned for the year without acting on a bill by Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) that would have increased fines for anyone selling tobacco products, including those for electronic cigarettes, to people under age 21. Gray decided to delay action on his measure until next year so he can explore adding a tax to the bill, a spokesman said. Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) had earlier proposed to ban the sale of most flavored tobacco products for e-cigarettes, arguing they attract underage users, but he shelved his bill when it was scaled back in a legislative committee. Hill hopes that the governor’s strong support for outlawing flavored tobacco products will help revive his effort in the next legislative session. “It certainly has inspired me and I know others to move forward quickly in the Legislature to get to and resolve this problem,” Hill said. Health groups iblamed the demise of the legislation on an intense lobbying campaign by tobacco companies. In July, the network issued a report that said the tobacco industry has provided more than $2.2 million in campaign contributions to state officials since 2014. According to the governor’s office, roughly 11% of high school students in California have reported using e-cigarettes, and more than 80% of students who reported using tobacco products use a vaping device. The governor blamed the increase in youth vaping on the tobacco companies’ use of flavored vapor, and advertising and marketing campaigns targeting young people. “Let’s just dispense with any niceties. You don’t have bubble gum flavor, mango-flavored tobacco products, unless you’re trying to target an audience that you are losing. That’s young people,” Newsom said. Last week, President Trump said his administration plans to ban vaping products with sweet and fruity flavors because of escalating concerns about health hazards caused by e-cigarettes and the increase in use by teenagers. “People are dying with vaping,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. “We have to find out the extent of the problem.”'},\n",

The Mercury News reported Monday that the company, Ontario-based RePlanet, has closed all 284 of its centers. RePlanet President David Lawrence said the company stopped operating because of increased business costs and falling prices of recycled aluminum and PET plastic. The move comes three years after RePlanet closed 191 of its recycling centers and laid off almost 300 employees. This leaves fewer options for people to redeem their recyclables, which is especially concerning for those who live in poverty or experience homelessness and rely on recycling for income.'},\n",
       " {'title': 'After $40-million embezzlement, former CBS credit union manager gets 14 years in jail',\n",
       "  'content': 'The former manager of the now-defunct CBS Employees Federal Credit Union has been sentenced to 14 years and one month in federal prison in connection with a two-decade embezzlement scheme that caused the cooperative to lose $40 million and forced it into insolvency. Edward Rostohar, 62, of Studio City, admitted he had gambled away much of the money and spent the rest on private jets and expensive cars and watches. He pleaded guilty to a felony count of bank fraud May 20. The scheme involved a series of payments Rostohar made to himself over the years using his position as a manager, some online and others via checks made payable to himself, prosecutors said. He began embezzling in 2000, according to a sentencing memorandum his attorneys filed. “The amounts were, at first, small,” Rostohar’s attorneys wrote. “But over time, between mounting, pathological gambling losses and failed business ideas that were supposed to make good the stolen funds, this amount ballooned to more than $25 million. “Combined with the interest those stolen funds should have been earning, the credit union discovered in 2019 that it was approximately $40 million poorer than it believed.” According to court documents, Rostohar was first exposed on March 6, when a credit union employee discovered a $35,000 check made payable to the manager. The employee then conducted an audit and discovered $3.775 million in checks made payable to Rostohar between January 2018 and March. Those checks included the forged signature of another employee, who did not give consent. Rostohar was arrested March 13, the day after he was suspended from work and his wife called police to say her husband was leaving the country, according to court documents. The National Credit Union Administration liquidated the CBS Employees Federal Credit Union on March 29 after determining it was insolvent and had no prospect of becoming viable. University Credit Union of Westwood assumed CBS Employees’ assets, loans and all member shares.'}]"
